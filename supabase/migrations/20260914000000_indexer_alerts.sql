-- Susu Protocol — indexer health alerts
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- The runbook calls the distance between the checkpoint and the chain tip "the
-- one number worth alerting on", and section 31 of the design document requires
-- alerts for a stale checkpoint, failed scheduled runs and abnormal errors.
-- Until this migration nothing alerted. `ledgerLag` was computed on every run
-- and returned in the function's own response, where nothing was reading it, so
-- a stopped indexer was visible only to a person who went looking for it.
--
-- That failure mode is worth stating precisely, because it is not a slow one.
-- Soroban RPC serves events from a rolling window. A checkpoint that falls far
-- enough behind crosses a deadline past which the missing events cannot be
-- fetched at any price, and the gap is permanent. Everything here exists to
-- notice long before that, while noticing is still cheap.
--
-- WHAT IT WATCHES
-- Three conditions, all read from state that already exists:
--
--   1. `stale_checkpoint` — the checkpoint has not advanced inside the window.
--      This is the actionable signal and it deliberately does not consult the
--      chain: a checkpoint that stops moving is how lag grows in the first
--      place, and this needs no RPC, no secret and no quota to evaluate.
--   2. `failed_run`       — the indexer recorded a failure. The newest reason
--      travels in the alert, because the reasons need different responses and
--      a validation fault must never be answered by loosening validation.
--   3. `failed_schedule`  — a scheduled invocation did not succeed. This covers
--      the class the run log cannot: runs that never started, or were rejected
--      before the indexer could record anything about them.
--
-- ONE ALERT PER CONDITION, NOT ONE PER CHECK
-- The check runs every fifteen minutes. An alert that fired on every pass would
-- be noise inside an hour and filtered away inside a day, which is how alerting
-- stops working. So a partial unique index permits exactly one open row per
-- (kind, subject); a condition that is still true refreshes that row's detail
-- rather than opening a second one; and a condition that clears resolves the row
-- rather than deleting it. The history stays readable: what broke, what it said,
-- and when it stopped.
--
-- SILENCE IS NOT HEALTH
-- If a URL is stored in Vault as `indexer_alert_webhook`, a newly opened alert
-- is posted there. If it is not stored, the alert is still recorded and nothing
-- is sent — so the table has to be looked at. An open alert with a null
-- `notified_at` is one that nobody was told about:
--
--   select kind, subject, detail, opened_at
--   from public.indexer_alerts
--   where resolved_at is null
--   order by opened_at desc;
--
-- This migration never disables RLS and grants nothing to a browser role.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Alerts: one row per condition, open until it clears.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
create table if not exists public.indexer_alerts (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  -- Constrained rather than free text so a typo in the producer cannot quietly
  -- create a category that no operator query or future rule knows about.
  kind text not null check (kind in ('stale_checkpoint', 'failed_run', 'failed_schedule')),
  -- The thing the condition is about: the checkpoint, or a cron job by name.
  subject text not null,
  detail jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
  opened_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  -- Set when the condition stopped being true. The row is kept.
  resolved_at timestamptz,
  -- Set when a notification was actually handed to the webhook. Null on an open
  -- alert means recorded but not sent.
  notified_at timestamptz,
  constraint indexer_alerts_resolved_after_opened
    check (resolved_at is null or resolved_at >= opened_at)
);

comment on table public.indexer_alerts is
  'One row per indexer health condition, open until it clears. Open rows with a null notified_at are alerts nobody was told about.';

-- At most one open alert per condition. This is what makes detection idempotent:
-- the check can run as often as it likes and the result is the same single row.

-- and is not optional — a definer function with a caller-controlled search_path
-- is how a definer function becomes a privilege escalation.
